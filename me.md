# Baek Seulkee

I am an independent researcher interested in application of formal methods to 
crypto. In particular, my current area of focus is verification of EVM smart 
contracts via interactive theorem proving.

I've previously worked on designing proof formats for automated reasoning tools,
and implementing automation tactics for interactive theorem provers. I mainly 
work with Lean, and I also have some experience with Coq, SAT solvers, and 
automated theorem provers for first-order logic.
