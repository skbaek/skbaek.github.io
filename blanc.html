<h1 id="blanc">Blanc</h1>
<p><a href="https://github.com/skbaek/blanc">GitHub repo</a></p>
<h2 id="what-is-it">What is it?</h2>
<p>Blanc is an EVM programming language designed for ease of formal
verification. You can use it to write EVM smart contracts, and use
theorem provers to write and prove their precise formal specifications.
This gives you extremely strong guarantees that the contracts behave
correctly per their specification.</p>
<h2 id="who-is-it-for">Who is it for?</h2>
<p>Those who find the following attractive.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Low abstraction level: in essence, Blanc is just EVM bytecode +
replacing jump instructions with branches and function calls. Although
this minimal abstraction makes a big difference for ease of programming
and verification, it is still lightweight enough to retain key benefits
of staying close to the EVM metal:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Verified compiler: verify statements about the bytecode that
actually runs on EVM, not about high-level semantics whose relationship
to runtime behaviour has to be taken on trust.</p></li>
<li><p>Freedom of low-level control: virtually any contract written in
EVM bytecode can also be written in Blanc, with the same benefits of
minute control and optimization. The foremost target users of Blanc are
developers who need both bytecode level optimization <em>AND</em> formal
verification, but are finding direct verification of bytecode too
laborious.</p></li>
<li><p>No pesky transformations: no need for a transformation step
bridging the high level at which programs &amp; specifications are
written vs. the low level (typically definitions in a theorem prover) at
which they are proven. Always reason about the code directly.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Natural modeling of contract calls: some formalizations of EVM
semantics, such as the widely referenced <a href="https://yoichihirai.com/malta-paper.pdf">LEM implementation</a>,
make a sharp distinction between the current contract vs. the outside
world, and model calls to external contracts as opaque transitions in
which anything can happen unless explicitly constrained. This makes it
difficult to show properties of contracts that make external calls
(which is a <em>lot</em> of them, considering even a simple ETH transfer
is a <code>CALL</code>!), and requires extra assumptions about invariant
conservation over external calls, whose addition is only justified by
informal arguments. Blanc is based on an EVM formalization in which
every EVM execution from start to finish is a seamless whole, such that
invariant conservation over external calls is merely an inductive
hypothesis that ‘falls out for free’ from structural induction.</p></li>
<li><p>EVM formalization verified by execution (work in progress):
verified compilers can bridge the gap between EVM and your programming
language semantics, but has limited utility if your formal definition of
EVM is faulty to begin with. How do you know that your EVM definition is
correct? Even if it was correct for older versions of EVM, how do you
know later EVM updates did not break your proofs? The only way to
robustly address such concerns, to my mind, is to have an
<em>executable</em> formalization of EVM whose behaviour can be
automatically checked agaist a large number of test cases. The <a href="https://github.com/skbaek/elevm">Executable Lean EVM (ELEVM)</a>
is a new Lean 4 formalization of EVM that can run state tests in
standard JSON format, whose correctness respect to Prague has been
verified by passing all general state tests from <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/execution-specs">execution-specs</a>.
Although Blanc is currently still based on an older EVM definition based
on the yellow paper, work is underway to replace it with ELEVM. When the
transition is complete, Blanc programs can be verified against the exact
version of EVM live on mainnet with high levels of correctness
guarantees.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="who-is-it-not-for">Who is it NOT for?</h2>
<p>Blanc, at least in its current form, is a decidedly ‘batteries not
included’ language. It has none of the programming structs you would
normally expect: no loops, no types, no data structures, no operator
syntax, not even local variables, nothing. This will be a dealbreaker
for most users who prefer the convenience and features of familliar
langauges, and are content with slightly less streamlined verification
or relaxed levels of formal rigor. It’s not designed to be a go-to
language, even for users who need formal verification (but it doesn’t
have to stay that way - see below).</p>
<h2 id="any-examples">Any examples?</h2>
<p>As an initial proof of concept, the Wrapped Ether (WETH) ERC-20
contract was re-implemented in Blanc, together with a formal proof that
it always stays solvent (i.e. contract ETH balance ≧ sum of all
liabilities) through all possible transactions. Notably, the Blanc
implementation’s compiled bytecode is 3.66 times smaller than the
original (854 bytes vs. 3124 bytes), and it also shows moderate gas
savings around a single digit % for every function in the contract,
showing the effectiveness of low-level optimizations. In addition, the
proof of concept also demonstrates of how formal verification is better
than any test set at catching even the most improbable edge cases: for
instance, the WETH implementation in Blanc had to be modified to store
user WETH balance data in a custom mapping instead of standard hashmaps
because the solvency proof required a guarantee that data corruption
from hash collisions cannot happen.</p>
<h2 id="whats-next">What’s next?</h2>
<p>Blanc is still very nascent, and much work is needed to make it a
pragmatic programming language. Current areas of focus include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Using ELEVM: the low hanging fruit, already mentioned above.
Required to ensure correctness in respect to the current Ethereum
mainnet.</p></li>
<li><p>Libraries: a standard library that implements a few of the most
heavily used programming structures &amp; features, and proves their
basic properties frequently used in verification, will go a long way to
making Blanc more usable out of the box. A crude example of this already
exists in the WETH implementation: its function dispatcher is completely
standard for all EVM smart contracts and can be reused as-is in other
projects, along with basic related lemmas like “if all functions in this
dispatch tree preserves property P, then running the contract preserves
P.” The standard library should include basic data structures, helper
functions for iteration, local variable management, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Tooling: Lean 4 is a ‘good enough’ IDE for Blanc for now, but
eventually Blanc will need its own dedicated toolchain. Blanc currently
has some very rough edges, such as forcing users to manually manage the
indices of functions in a contract, or mentally keep track of stack
state after each opcode. Proper tooling should abstract and automate
them away so that programmers can focuse on higher level
features.</p></li>
<li><p>More real usage: ultimately, all of the efforts above have to
prove their usefulness by application to examples more complex than an
ERC-20 token. Ideally, the example would be a smart contract difficult
to write and verify using other existing methods due to requiring both
aggressive optimizations and a tiny trust base, thereby showcasing
Blanc’s strengths.</p></li>
